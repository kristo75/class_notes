###Databases and SQL###

A database should be able to CRUD.  Create, Read, Update and Delete.
SQL is the language that allows us to do this.  Structured Query language.
to do this, we use postgres.  psql (in terminal).  To exit psql, type \q.
Postgres is open source and considered to be one of the better ones to use.
Names of tables are always plural.  This is a convention but not necessary
for it to work.
CREATE DATABASE star_wars; to create a database.  must end with a semi colon.
SQL key words are written in Caps.
Now exit from psql (\q) back to terminal and create a file.
VARCHAR must have single quotes in SQL
In SQL NIL is NULL.

#Create a file using touch star_wars.sql
CREATE TABLE jedis (
  name VARCHAR (255), (255 is the number of characters allowed, VARCHAR is various Characters)
  age INT,
  darkside BOOLEAN
);

DROP TABLE jedis; must be used each time that you update a table.
this will delete the previous table name and replace it with the
updated version.

SERIAL is an integer that sequentialy runs automatically to create the id.

to run the file enter      psql -d star_wars -f ./star_wars.sql

#To read the table (print out the table)
SELECT *  FROM jedis will return all of the data
