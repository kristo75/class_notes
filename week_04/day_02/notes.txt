###Day 2 notes###
Ruby -- Database -- Web server
HyperText Transfer Protocol - HTTP (agreed language between computers.
Can send HTML, CSS, JS, PDF, JSON etc...)


http://sinatrarb.com (web framework) Sinatra handles HTTP stuff.

            CRUD
POST - Creating
GET - Read
PUT - Update
DELETE - Delete

MVC (View, controller, model)
-Models is Ruby code
-View is the front end (HTML what will display to users)
-Controller sits in the middle and acts as a middle man between
view and model.

.ERB (imbed ruby code)

Yield looks to views folders only.
