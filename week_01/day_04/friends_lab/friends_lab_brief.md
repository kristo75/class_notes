# Friends Lab

We have a bunch of information about a set of friends.
We're going to find out some interesting information about them using TDD.

We need to to complete the tasks in the comments of the `friends_spec.rb` file.
Write your tests in that file first, then write the function to pass the test in `friends.rb`.
There is one example test and function already.
If you get stuck, there are hints on how to approach the problem for each question.

Also note that this is the first time where we might not test the return value of a function (read the hint for question 4)
